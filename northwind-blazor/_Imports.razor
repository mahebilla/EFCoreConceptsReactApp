    _IMPORTS.RAZOR — Blazor Concept: Global Using Directives

    React equivalent: No direct equivalent — each file imports what it needs.
    Angular equivalent: No direct equivalent (standalone components import dependencies).

    This file adds @using directives to ALL .razor files in the project.
    Without it, you'd need @using lines at the top of every component.
    Think of it as a project-wide "import * from" statement.
